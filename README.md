ULX_stafflist
==============

Voodoo(STEAM_0:1:28607710)
Adds a command for users that shows currently connected admins online.

To install
==============
Place in GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons\

the full path once placed will look like: GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons\ULX_Adminlist\lua\ulx\modules\sh\ulx_adminlist.lua

Note: 
==============
Current hardcoded values for ranks are: {'helper','moderator','admin','superadmin','owner'}, if a rank's title is changed ingame, be sure to update
it here as well. A fall back will still show admins but extra ranks such as 'helper' or 'moderator' will possibly not show until changed.
